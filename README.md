# [Bento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento) üç± ÂºÅÂΩì

> #### is a single-portion take-out or home-packed meal common in Japanese cuisine. A traditional bento holds rice or noodles, fish or meat, with pickled and cooked vegetables, in a box.

**Bento** is a Swift library for building component-based interfaces on top of `UITableView`.

- **Declarative:**  provides a painless approach for building `UITableView` interfaces
- **Diffing:** reloads your UI with beautiful animations when your data changes
- **Component-based:**  Design reusable components and share your custom UI across multiple screens of your app

In our experience it makes UI-related code easier to build and maintain. Our aim is to make the UI a function of state (`UI = f(state)`), which makes `Bento` a perfect fit for Reactive Programming.

### What's it like? üßê

When building a `Box`, all you need to care about are `Sections`s and `Node`s.

```swift
let box = Box<SectionId, RowId>.empty
                |-+ Section(id: SectionId.user,
                            header: EmptySpaceComponent(height: 24, color: .clear))
                |---+ RowId.user <> IconTitleDetailsComponent(icon: image, title: patient.name)
                |-+ Section(id: SectionId.consultantDate,
                            header: EmptySpaceComponent(height: 24, color: .clear))
                |---+ RowId.loading <> LoadingIndicatorComponent(isLoading: true)
                
tableView.render(box)
```

### How does it work? ü§î

#### Box üì¶

`Box ` is a fundamental component of the library, essentially a virtual representation of the `UITableView` content. It has two generic parameters - `SectionId` and `RowId` - which are unique identifiers for  `Section<SectionId, RowId>` and `Node<RowId>`, used by the [diffing engine](https://github.com/RACCommunity/FlexibleDiff) to perform animated changes of the `UITableView` content.

#### Sections and Nodes üèó

A `Section` and a `Node` are building blocks of the `Box`:

- The `Section` is an abstraction of `UITableView`'s section, which defines whether there is going to be any header or footer.
- The `Node` is an abstraction of `UITableView`'s row, it defines how it's going be rendered.

```swift
struct Section<SectionId: Hashable, RowId: Hashable> {
    let id: SectionId
    let header: AnyRenderable?
    let footer: AnyRenderable?
    let rows: [Node<RowId>]
}

public struct Node<Identifier: Hashable> {
    let id: Identifier
    let component: AnyRenderable
}
```


#### Identity üé´
Identity is one of the key concepts,  which is used by the diffing algorithm to perform changes.

 > For general business concerns, full inequality of two instances does not necessarily mean inequality in terms of identity ‚Äî it just means the data being held has changed if the identity of both instances is the same.
 
 (More info [here](https://github.com/RACCommunity/FlexibleDiff).)

There are `SectionId` and `RowId` which define identity of  the `Section` and the `Row` respectively.

#### Renderable üñº

`Renderable` is similar to [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)'s [Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)s. It's an abstraction of the real `UITableViewCell` that is going to be displayed. The idea is to make it possible to develop small independent components that can be reused across many parts of your app.

```swift
public protocol Renderable: class {
    associatedtype View: UIView
    
    func render(in view: View)
}

class IconTextComponent: Renderable {
    private let title: String
    private let image: UIImage

    init(image: UIImage,
         title: String) {
        self.image = image
        self.title = title
    }

    func render(in view: IconTextCell) {
        view.titleLabel.text = title
        view.iconView.image = image
    }
}
```

#### Bento's arithmetics üí°

There are several custom operators that provide syntax sugar to make it easier to build `Bento`s:

```swift
precedencegroup ComposingPrecedence {
    associativity: left
    higherThan: NodeConcatenationPrecedence
}

precedencegroup NodeConcatenationPrecedence {
    associativity: left
    higherThan: SectionConcatenationPrecedence
}

precedencegroup SectionConcatenationPrecedence {
    associativity: left
    higherThan: AdditionPrecedence
}

infix operator <>: ComposingPrecedence
infix operator |-+: SectionConcatenationPrecedence
infix operator |--+: NodeConcatenationPrecedence

let bento = Box.empty // 3
	|-+ Section() // 2
	|---+ RowId.id <> Component() // 1
```

As you can see, `<>` has a BitwiseShiftPrecedence, `|---+` has a `NodeConcatenationPrecedence `, which is higher then `|-+`, `SectionConcatenationPrecedence`, which means that Nodes will be computed first. The order of the expression above is:

1.  `RowId.id <> Component()` => `Node`
2. `Section() |---+ Node()` => `Section`
3. `Box() |-+ Section()` => `Box`
